# IPL_MATCH-prediction-ML-model
IPL Score Prediction 🔥🏏

This project uses IPL match data to build a machine learning model that predicts the final score of a team based on match situation.
📂 Project Overview

Preprocesses the dataset containing details like:
Batting team
Bowling team
Runs, Wickets, Overs
Runs & Wickets in last 5 overs
Encodes categorical variables (batting_team, bowling_team) using OneHotEncoder.
Generates correlation heatmaps to understand relationships between match features.
Trains predictive models to estimate the total score.

⚙️ Tech Stack
